## Technology Overview

**DryFogSÂ© (Dry Fog System)** is a proprietary technology based on continuous production of "dry fog" in the form of stable and dry aerosol, designed to micronize water-based products for environmental and surface treatments.

### Key Characteristics
- **Particle Size**: 4-5 Î¼m average diameter
- **Technology**: Ultrasonic aerosol generation
- **Certification**: University of Parma - Department of Food and Drug Sciences
- **Application**: Environmental disinfection and surface treatment

---

## Physical Process

The DryFogSÂ© technology operates through a specific ultrasonic frequency range that creates turbulence within a chamber containing water-based liquids. This process generates an aerosol composed of billions of micro-droplets (sonication) with inherent kinetic energy and electrostatic charge.

### Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Particle Size | <5 Î¼m | Optimized range |
| Average Diameter | 4-5 Î¼m | University certified |
| Electrostatic Charge | Positive | Same polarity |
| Power Consumption | 800W max | DFS-4 model |
| Coverage Area | Up to 500 mÂ² | DFS-4 model |

### Process Characteristics

1. **Micro-droplet Generation**: Ultrasonic frequencies create controlled turbulence
2. **Size Selection**: Only particles <6 Î¼m are released; larger droplets are condensed and recovered
3. **Electrostatic Charging**: Particles acquire positive charge, preventing agglomeration
4. **Uniform Distribution**: Charged particles repel each other, ensuring even coverage
5. **Surface Penetration**: Particles penetrate porous surfaces and hard-to-reach areas

## Scientific Validation

### University of Parma Certification
The average diameter of micro-droplets has been certified by the **Department of Food and Drug Sciences, University of Parma** through air sedimentation velocity measurements.

### Laboratory Testing (SIGLA Srl)
Comprehensive testing conducted to analyze product deposition quality on vertical glass surfaces using titanium dioxide (ANATASE) nanoparticles as markers.

**Test Conditions:**
- Environment: 15 mÂ³ confined space
- Humidity increase: 25% relative humidity
- Marker: <0.1% titanium dioxide in distilled water
- Device: DFS-4 model

## Scientific Tests & Results

### Test 1: Electrostatic Polarization Verification

**Objective**: Confirm electrostatic charging of aerosol particles  
**Method**: Neodymium magnets positioned behind parallel glass slides to create uniform magnetic field  
**Results**: Microscopic observation showed nearly complete migration of aerosol particles toward the north-south direction of the magnetic field, confirming positive electrostatic charge.

**Significance**: This confirms that DryFogSÂ© particles are electrostatically charged, enabling superior surface adhesion and coverage.

### Test 2: Deposition Uniformity Analysis

**Objective**: Evaluate uniform surface coverage  
**Method**: Vertical glass slide positioned without magnets  
**Results**: Microscopic analysis revealed compact and uniform surface coverage with particles remaining separate until surface contact.

**Key Findings:**
- Particles maintain separation during flight due to same-polarity repulsion
- Uniform coating achieved without agglomeration
- No moisture traces left on surfaces
- Complete surface coverage prevents microbial development

### Test 3: Comparative Analysis - DryFogSÂ© vs Traditional Turbine

**Objective**: Compare deposition quality with conventional nebulization  
**Method**: Same test conditions using turbine atomization technology  
**Results**: 

| Technology | Particle Behavior | Surface Coverage | Efficiency |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| DryFogSÂ© | No agglomeration | Uniform coating | High |
| Turbine | Droplet clustering | Irregular patches | Low |

**Conclusion**: Traditional turbine technology showed irregular deposition with particle clustering, resulting in gaps that compromise antimicrobial treatment effectiveness.
